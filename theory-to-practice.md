# Theory to Practice

## Suggested Further Readings

(For instance)[https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/ethics/blob/master/sections/resources.md]

- [The Bash Manual (by Free Software Foundation)](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html)
- If the reading has a DOI number, make sure to add it. If it does, you do not need to add any additional bibliographic information.

## Other Tutorials

- Use bullet points for each of the sources (in markdown, you use - on a new line to create a bullet point).

## Projects or Challenges to Try

- [Pandoc, an online software that allows users to switch file types (from markdown to PDF, for example)](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown)

- Further exploration, possible little projects
- Exercises from other open source tutorials
- Programming Historian
