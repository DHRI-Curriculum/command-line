# Assessment

## Quantitative Self-Assessment

Before beginning the workshop, how confident did you feel about using the command line?

- I had used the command line before, so this was nothing new to me.
- I had some experience using the command line, but I felt I could improve. 
- I had used the command line to run some basic commands and browse my hard drive, but I had not used it to create a file or to run complex operations.
- I had heard of the command line, but was unsure how or when to use it.
- I had never heard of the command line before taking this workshop.

After completing the command line workshop, I would say that:

- I learned very little.
- I modestly increased my confidence using the command line.
- I discovered new ways to use the command line. 
- I significantly increased my capacity to use the command line.
